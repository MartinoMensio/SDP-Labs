Note
----

All students are requested to *up-load* on the class "portal" web page
the solution of Exercise 01 and 02.
Up-load the source code, i.e., the ".cpp" file (in tar-gzipped format,
if necessary), with explanatory comments on top of the program
(if necessary).
Please, follow the course rules to deliver the laboratory solution.



Laboratory target
-----------------

- Synchronizing threads with semaphores and events
- Error handling
- Concurrent programming with processes and synchronization
  through file locking



Exercise 01 (versions A and B)
------------------------------

Implement the following version of the producer-consumer scheme.
A concurrent program runs 4 working threads.
Each thread iterates through a cycle waiting for 32-bit integer
values:
- the first thread computes the sum of all values and for each new
  value it prints-out (on standard output) the partial sum of the
  numbers received until that moment
- the second thread computes and prints-out (on standard output)
  the partial product of the numbers
- the third thread computes and prints-out (on standard output)
  the factorial of the current number
- the fourth thread prints-out (on standard output) a number
  of '#' characters equal to the value on the same line of the
  standard output.

The four threads have to synchronize with a main thread which is in
charge of reading all integer numbers from a file.
The file name is received on the command line and it stores a variable
length sequence of integer 32-bit numbers.
When the file ends the main thread has to terminate all four working
threads and it has to stop.

In this producer-and-consumer scheme think about the differences
between semaphores (or mutexes or critical sections) and Windows
events.
How would you implement:
- A version of the program using semaphores.
- A version of the program using Windows-32 events.


Suggestions/Comments
--------------------
- Notice that the 4 secondary threads have to wait numbers coming
  from the main thread, but the main thread has to wait those
  threads to do their job before reading the next value from
  file.
- In the semaphore version, are 2 semaphores sufficient to synchronize
  all threads in a proper way?
- In the event version which are the limitations?



Exercise 02
-----------

A file contains a sequence of 32-bit values in binary form.
A program receives a file name on the command line and runs
two threads:

* The first thread:
  - Reads from the file pairs of value n1, n2
  - Computes their ratios n1/n2
  - Prints-out on standard output n1, n2 and n1/n2

  The thread has to handle exceptions for:
  - Trying to opening a non-existing file, file handle exception
  - Performing a division by zero, mathematical exception
  - Reading file with an odd number of value (the n2 value for
    the last pair does not exist)

* The second thread
  - Considers the first integer stored in the file as an array size
  - Dynamically allocates an array of that size
  - Stores all subsequent values within the file into the array
  - Orders the array and prints it out on standard output.

  The thread has to handle exceptions for:
  - Wrong (array) memory allocation
  - Wrong memory access, during array element read or write
  - Reading a number of values from file larger than the array
    size, i.e., array bound exception.

Notice that when one thread handles an exception it has to force
to a clean termination the other thread, i.e., memory has to be
free (no memory leaks), files have to be closed, etc.



Exercise 03
-----------

Write a client-server application, based on two *processes*
which communicate using an intermediate file.

Process A (the client) works as follow:
- It opens a temporary file for writing (use GetTempFileName to
  obtain a unique file name).
- It starts Process B passing as argument the name of the file.
- It reads from standard input strings of characters, and it writes
  those strings on the intermediate file.
  Use string of constant length (e.g., #define MAX_LEN 100).
- It stops reading strings from standard input when it receives an
  end-of-file (ctrl-Z).
- Before terminating, it writes the string
  ".end"
  as last line of the file.

Process B (the server) works as follows:
- It opens the intermediate file for reading.
- It reads lines as soon as they are available, and it prints them
  out on standard output.

Suggestions:
- Process A keeps the file open, and it always locks the next part of
  the file before unlocking the previous part.
- Process B runs in parallel, and it reads a shared file, waiting to
  have access to single lines to read them.
